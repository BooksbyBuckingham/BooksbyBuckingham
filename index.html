    <p>Before starting my career in accounting, I proudly served in the U.S. Army for 6 years, where I learned the discipline, precision, and integrity that I now bring to every client relationship. After transitioning to civilian life, I worked in public accounting roles and am currently pursuing my CPA to deepen my expertise even further.</p>
    <p>I started Books by Buckingham to give business owners peace of mind knowing their books are clean, accurate, and handled with care. Whether you‚Äôre a solo entrepreneur or running a growing team, I‚Äôm here to make your financial life easier ‚Äî so you can focus on what you do best.</p>
